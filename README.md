This is a dead-simple Sticky Notes App that lets you create notes and save them to your Browser's Local Storage. It's totally offline, has a nice colorful UI and Smooth Animations. Though this project doesn't actually have point to exist in real world, it's fun and I enjoyed working on this basic project so much.
